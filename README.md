Assignment 4 - Components
===

Due: October 11th, by 11:59 PM.

For this assignment you will re-implement the client side portion of A3 using either React or Svelte components.

This project can be implemented on any hosting service (Glitch, DigitalOcean, Heroku etc.), however, you must include all files in your GitHub repo so that the course staff can view them; these files are not available for viewing in many hosting systems.

Do the following to complete this assignment:

1. Implement your project with the above requirements.
3. Test your project to make sure that when someone goes to your main page on Glitch/Heroku/etc., it displays correctly.
4. Ensure that your project has the proper naming scheme `a4-firstname-lastname` so we can find it.
5. Fork this repository and modify the README to the specifications below. Be sure to add *all* project files.
6. Create and submit a Pull Request to the original repo. Name the pull request using the following template: `a4-firstname-lastname`.

In this iteration I added React framework to my project. React made it easier to dynamically show the data, however integrating it with glitch proved very tough,
and I ran into issues that I didn't have when I was using javascript, such as CORS issues, and proxy issues since there needed to be two servers running on the
backend.
